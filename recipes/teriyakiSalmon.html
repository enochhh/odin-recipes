                <h3>For the Teriyaki Sauce</h3>
                <li>3 tbsp teriyaki sauce</li>
                <li>3 tbsp hoisin sauce</li>
                <li>1 tbsp white vinegar</li>
                <li>1 tbsp sesame oil</li>
                <li>1/3 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
                <li>2 large or 3 medium garlic cloves, minced</li>
                <li>2 tsp freshly grated ginger, or 1/2 tsp ground ginger</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Grease a large rimmed baking sheet (cover with foil and then grease for easier clean-up). Preheat oven to 400ËšF.</li>
                <li>Combine sauce ingredients and stir until brown sugar is dissolved.</li>
                <li>Place individual salmon slices in a mixing bowl. Pour the sauce over the salmon, cover with plastic wrap and let marinate 20 minutes (at room temp or refrigerated).</li>
                <li>Transfer salmon to prepared baking sheet (keep the marinade). Bake at 400 for 12-16 min or until salmon is flaky and cooked through, bake times may vary by thickness of salmon.</li>
                <li>While salmon is baking, transfer remaining marinade to a small sauce pan and bring to a boil then reduce heat to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally until slightly thickened (3-4 min) then remove from heat.</li>
                <li>Once salmon is out of the oven, brush with teriyaki syrup, then sprinkle with chopped green onion and sesame seeds as desired.</li>
            </ol>
