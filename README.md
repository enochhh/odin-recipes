# Odin Recipes

It is 12:29 AM on January 8, 2022. I've decided to buckle down and take my learning seriously by going through The Odin Project. This Recipes project is an intro project into using HTML to create web pages. 

## What Did I Learn?
* Different HTML tags (<p>, <a>, <h>)
* Creating the HTML boilerplate
* Linking images to HTML pages
* Structuring the project
